  Course 1: Python Programming Essentials
 </p>
 </h2>
 
This course introduces the wonderful world of Python programming!  We'll learn about the essential elements of programming and how to construct basic Python programs. We will cover expressions, variables, functions, logic, and conditionals, which are foundational concepts in computer programming. We will also teach you how to use Python modules, which enable you to benefit from the vast array of functionality that is already a part of the Python language. These concepts and skills will help you to begin to think like a computer programmer and to understand how to go about writing Python programs.

  Course 2: Python Data Representations
 </p>
 </h2>
 
This course continues the introduction to Python programming that started with Python Programming Essentials.  We'll learn about different data representations, including strings, lists, and tuples, that form the core of all Python programs.  We will also teach you how to access files, which will allow you to store and retrieve data within your programs. These concepts and skills will help you to manipulate data and write more complex Python programs.

  Course 3: Python Data Analysis
 </p>
 </h2>
 
This course continues the introduction to Python programming that started with Python Programming Essentials and Python Data Representations.  We'll learn about reading, storing, and processing tabular data, which are common tasks.  We will also teach you about CSV files and Python's support for reading and writing them.  CSV files are a generic, plain text file format that allows you to exchange tabular data between different programs. These concepts and skills will help you to further extend your Python programming knowledge and allow you to process more complex data.

  Course 4: Python Data Visualization
 </p>
 </h2>

This is the final course in the specialization which builds upon the knowledge learned in Python Programming Essentials, Python Data Representations, and Python Data Analysis.  We will learn how to install external packages for use within Python, acquire data from sources on the Web, and then we will clean, process, analyze, and visualize that data. This course will combine the skills learned throughout the specialization to enable you to write interesting, practical, and useful programs.
