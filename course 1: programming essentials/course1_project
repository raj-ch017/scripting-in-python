Project Description: Working with Dates


In many scripting tasks, you will need to work with dates.  You often have collections of data that come from different times and dates. 
You may want to sort events based on when they occurred, aggregate information from a single day, calculate the time between two events, 
or do other processing based on dates.

In this project, you will write four functions to do simple processing on dates using Python's datetime module. 
This will help familiarize you with writing Python functions, using modules in Python, and working with dates in Python.
